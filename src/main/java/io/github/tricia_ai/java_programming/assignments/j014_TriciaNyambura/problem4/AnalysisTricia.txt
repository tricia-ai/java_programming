PROBLEM 1
public void calculateBonus() {
        return salary * 0.1;
    }
In the above code there is a return which is not a valid statement as the
method is void thus cannot return anything.

PROBLEM 2
public static String companyName;
If set to public anyone can change its value therefore needs to be of access type
protected or private given the required access.

PROBLEM 3
salary = salary;
Use this.salary to refer to the created object is salary is not specific to
the created

PROBLEM 4
public EmployeeManagement(String name) {
        employeeName = name;
    }
The constructor should be able to take in the salary too when an object is instantiated.
